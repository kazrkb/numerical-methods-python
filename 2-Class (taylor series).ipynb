    "The final expression is an infinite series of polynomials.  The first term is the constant term, the second term is the linear term, the third term is the quadratic term, the fourth term is the cubic term, and so on.  The more terms we include in the series, the more accurate the approximation of the function becomes. We will explore this in the next section."
